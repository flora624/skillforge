            <p>
              The tech industry is evolving at lightning speed, and developers must continuously update their skills to remain competitive. Here's a breakdown of the <strong>top technical and soft skills</strong> to learn in 2025 to future-proof your career.
            </p>

            <h2>1. JavaScript & TypeScript</h2>
            <p>
              These remain the backbone of modern web development. TypeScript, with its type safety and scalability, is especially valued in large applications. If you're building with <strong>React</strong> or <strong>Next.js</strong>, TypeScript is quickly becoming a standard.
            </p>

            <h2>2. AI & Machine Learning</h2>
            <p>
              AI isn’t just hype—it’s shaping products across industries. Learning <strong>Python</strong>, and working with tools like <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, <strong>PyTorch</strong>, and <strong>OpenAI APIs</strong> will keep you on the bleeding edge of innovation.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)</h2>
            <p>
              Cloud computing is no longer optional. Understanding cloud fundamentals and services like AWS Lambda, S3, and EC2 can land you high-paying roles in DevOps, backend engineering, and full-stack development.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Soft Skills & Communication</h2>
            <p>
              Collaboration, adaptability, and clear communication are what differentiate good developers from great ones. In remote or hybrid teams, soft skills are just as important as technical proficiency.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Frontend Frameworks: React, Next.js</h2>
            <p>
              These frameworks dominate frontend hiring requirements. Learning <strong>React</strong> for component-based design and <strong>Next.js</strong> for server-side rendering and SEO optimization gives you a major edge.
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Stay curious and consistent. By focusing on these high-impact skills, you’ll be well-equipped to thrive in 2025’s job market and beyond.
            </p>
